                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>WindIOT is a anemometer that is solar powered and uses cellular data for transmitting data. One
                        unique feature is
                        the wind direction instrument has single degree resolution. It uses a magnetically coupled
                        pointer and hall
                        effect IC to measure with high resolution. When on a buoy, a compass provides the relative
                        heading of the system
                        so that the true wind direction can be calculated.
                    </p>
                    <p>The controller is an Electron by Particle.io, it is an Arduino based system with built in
                        cellular data and solar
                        controller, perfect for a remote system. Particle.io provides web hooks for passing on the
                        transmitted data and
                        POSTing it to a website.
                    </p>
                    <p>The system has been in development for several years as a night time project, it was deployed for
                        the first time
                        the summer of 2021 where it worked very well. It was placed on an 18” diameter racing buoy about
                        ½ mile
                        offshore. Sending data to the Pultneyville Yacht Club’s web server every 20 minutes for display
                        on the club’s
                        website. The summer deployment did indicate some issues, the biggest is that if we had 3 cloudy
                        days in a row
                        the solar panels could not keep up. So, for 2022 a bigger battery and maybe turning off cellular
                        data between
                        11PM and 5AM.
                    </p>
                    <p>The system is meant to built in a workshop of moderate means, I have a basic tool box, a drill
                        press and chop saw
                        will make the frame building easer. There are twelve 3D printed parts that can be printed on a
                        small printer
                        with PLA or PETG. There are two custom PCBs – one through hole and the other surface mount, so a
                        soldering kit
                        is required.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Wind Speed and Direction - 10 minutes of data analyzed for gust & average wind speed and
                            direction.
                        </li>
                        <li>Air and Water Temperature every 20 minutes
                        </li>
                        <li>Cellular data modem - data send to server every 20 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Two 6” Solar cells and onboard battery - can handle several days without sun.
                        </li>
                        <li>Low power and hibernate modes
                        </li>
                        <li>Designed to waterproof IP68 standard to survive on the buoy.
